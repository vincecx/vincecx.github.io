**Abstract**
<br>
Over the past decade, studies of spontaneously vaporizing water droplets under reduced pressure have revealed complex multiphase dynamics. Notably, overpressure generated by constrained vapor flow between a vaporizing droplet and its substrate can induce Leidenfrost-like levitation and trampolining behaviors [1]. In addition, recalescence can trigger burst vaporization through the release of latent heat [2-4], driving asymmetric vaporization on freezing droplets and resulting in rapid self-propulsion [1, 5-7]. These phenomena underscore the intricate physics of coupled phase transitions and motivate further investigation into their interactions.
Here, we investigate how solute addition, specifically glycerol, modifies the vaporization-induced dynamics. We show that glycerol substantially suppresses self-propulsion by lowering the equilibrium freezing temperature, thereby weakening the propulsive vaporization associated with recalescence. Instead, partially frozen droplets exhibit spontaneous levitation, cycling through stages of dwelling, liftoff, flight, and impact. We develop a theoretical model demonstrating how freezing point depression suppresses self-propulsion while enabling the accumulation of vapor overpressure beneath the droplet, which drives the observed cyclic levitation. This work advances the understanding of vaporization-induced droplet dynamics and provides novel insights into droplet manipulation in low-pressure environments.
